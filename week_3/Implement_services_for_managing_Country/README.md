# Country Management Services

This module provides a set of services for managing country-related data as part of the Cognizant DN 4.0 Deep Skilling program (Week 3).

## Overview

The goal of this program is to implement backend services for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting (CRUD) country information. These services are designed to demonstrate best practices in RESTful API design, data validation, and service-layer abstraction.

## Features

- **Add Country:** Create a new country entry with relevant details.
- **Get Country:** Retrieve information about a specific country or list all countries.
- **Update Country:** Modify the details of an existing country.
- **Delete Country:** Remove a country from the system.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java (Spring Boot) / Python (Flask/FastAPI) / Node.js (Express) *(Choose the stack as per your implementation)*
- RESTful API principles
- Data persistence: In-memory storage, file, or database (depending on the scope)
- Unit testing framework

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to this folder.
2. **Install dependencies** based on the chosen tech stack.
3. **Run the service** using your preferred method (e.g., `mvn spring-boot:run`, `python app.py`, `npm start`).
4. **Test the endpoints** using tools like Postman or curl.

## Example Endpoints

- `GET    /countries` — List all countries
- `GET    /countries/{id}` — Get details of a country
- `POST   /countries` — Add a new country
- `PUT    /countries/{id}` — Update an existing country
- `DELETE /countries/{id}` — Remove a country
